This project was an attempt to run data analytics on network traffic in order to try to reveal insights into botnet traffic vs regular legitimate traffic. TCP and UDP streams were taken from botnet datasets from [Stratosphere IPS](https://www.stratosphereips.org/stratosphere-ips-for-linux). The data was separated into corresponding data streams and analytics calculated on those streams. This project was my first experience into how to deal with larger datasets. These datasets were not big enough to read entirely into memory and each script took hours to run. I learned several new skills in this project including how to stream large datasets for analytics, how to leverage multiprocessing pools to speed up script processing and how to use pandas to calculate analytics. This project was written primarily in Python and leveraged the nmap and wireshark libraries for network processing.
